* Setup
** Memcached
   - you must install memcached for the session store
   - and start/enabled it in systemd or however your OS does it
** Postgres
  1. install postgres and libpq-dev (or your OS's equivalent)
  2. start the service or whatever, again OS dependant
  3. sudo su to the postgres user
  4. run createuser nj
  5. run psql
  6. run alter user nj with superuser;
     1. this isn't a super secure thing to do but it will do for now
     2. alternatively you can run createdb netjam and netjam_api_test and create a new superuser and nj and grant nj permissions on those tables
     3. i'll make the process better at some point
** Mongo
   1. honestly i have no idea. I don't think any special setup is required besides installing and having mongo running.
   2. tested on mongodb version 3.2.9
** Rails
  1. install rvm
  2. install ruby 2.3.0 with rvm
  3. do gem install bundler rails
  4. clone the repo
  5. run bundle install in the directory
  6. run bin/rails db:setup


* Use
  - after setup you can start rails in dev mode with 'bin/rails s'
  - to run with google secret keys, copy the google doc into secrets.txt and run devserver.sh
  - and you can open an interaction console with 'bin/rails c'
** Test
   run rake spec to run spec tests
